# Herald and Contact Tracing

Herald was originally created to solve the problem of very variable and unreliable
Bluetooth mechanisms on Android and iOS devices. Over 40 techniques and workarounds
are present in how Herald works.

As it turns out these same problems are also applicable for a wide range of
[other applications]({{"/applications" | relative_url }}).

Herald supports over 98% of phones worldwide - this includes phones that do not
support advertising their presence themselves. Many contact tracing protocols in
use today fail to take this scenario in to account, meaning they miss around
35% of all Android phone users.

Reliability of the Bluetooth stacks within Android and iOS is also very questionable,
requiring exact protocol use and testing to workaround. This takes application
developers away from solving medical and epidemiological problems. By using Herald,
these teams can again concentrate on their residents and patients and leave
the reliable Bluetooth messaging and range finding to Herald.

## All about contact tracing

Please see the [Contact tracing introduction]({{"/background" | relative_url }})
for a discussion of the many issues with manual and mobile contact tracing.

## What does Herald provide?

The API itself provides a reliable [Protocol]({{"/protocol" | relative_url }})
for exchanging information. You can either use your own or one of our suggested
[Payload specifications]({{"/payload" | relative_url }}) on top of the Herald
protocol.

## International Interoperability (As of v1.1)

By adopting the [Herald envelope]({{"/payload/envelope" | relative_url }})
for your contact tracing app (supported by all our suggested payloads) you
will ensure that wherever your country's residents travel to, their application
can be used as-is internationally. We recommend the
[Secured payload]({{"/payload/secured" | relative_url }})
in this instance.

## Automated check-in (Expected v1.2)

Using the new [Herald Beacon Payload]({{"/payload/beacon" | relative_url }})
a phone supporting the detection of Herald Beacons (but using ANY contact
tracing protocol) can build up a diary of check-ins and check-outs from
venues. 

This means people don't have to remember to scan QR codes for locations which is
error prone. Multiple beacons can be placed in big venues, hospitals, or company
campusses with specific area names to provide more fine-grained exposure
notifications. 

Herald Beacons also track the full time from check-in to check-out
to minimise false exposure notifications to wrong people who happened to turn up
on the same day, but at different times and areas within a venue, to people who
were ill.

## Wearables (Expected v1.2)

For younger school children without phones, or for the elderly too, a contact
tracing solution is needed. A cheap Bluetooth enabled wearable is a good solution
here. This may or may not be backed up by a local Bluetooth mesh network
to reduce the cost of the end device.

We are implementing Herald in C++ for Windows and Embedded use cases. Our first
target platform will be Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 usb dongles for our
reference implementation. This uses the Zephyr open source real time operating
system (RTOS). This is currently in Alpha development.
