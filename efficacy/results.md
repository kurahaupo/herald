# Testing Results

Below is a list of the Protocols we have tested formally, or who have independently tested
using our Fair Efficacy Measure.

Note: The theoretical max efficacy in the UK given our phone mix, and perfect radio conditions, is 76.39%.

The Ferretti et al paper [[6]]({{"/efficacy/bibliography#a-6" | relative_url }}) shows a 'same day' efficacy requirement of 30%,
with an error range between 10 and 57%. This assumes a 90% effective lockdown of ill people.
Thus in our paper we call:-

- 57%+ 'Very effective'
- 30%+ 'Effective'
- 10%+ 'Limited effectiveness'
- Less than 10% 'not effective'

See the [Fair Efficacy Paper page]({{"/efficacy/paper" | relative_url }}) for details on how these values are defined and derived in testing.
